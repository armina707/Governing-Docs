\subsection{Ratification Process}
\label{ratification-process}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item
  To become an MES Affiliate, you must email the DoC your intent to become an MES Affiliate.
 \item
  After meeting with the DoC, all intending MES Affiliates must put forth a motion for affiliation at a Council Meeting. Council will vote on the motion and the DoC will assist you with the next steps whatever the result!
 \item
  To become an MES Group, you must be an MES Affiliate for at least one year, then let the DoC know your intent to apply to be an MES Group.
 \item
  Each MES Affiliate intending to become an MES Group must present a motion to MES Council to be recommended to the General Meeting. Upon a majority vote from Council, the MES Affiliate must submit a motion for ratification at the second General Meeting in a given academic year (See MES Bylaws Section \ref{general-meetings-sagm}).

  \begin{enumerate}
   \item
    On a majority vote at the General Meeting, the MES Affiliate will be ratified as a Group recognized by the MES.
   \item
    Motions may be put forth at the first General Meeting in a given academic year only by direct permission from the DoC.
  \end{enumerate}
 \item
  Long-established groups may be able to bypass the affiliation stage and become directly ratified as an MES Group.

  \begin{enumerate}
   \item
    This follows the same ratification process for MES Affiliates, wherein Council will motion whether to send the group to the Semi Annual General Meeting for ratification.
  \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{De-Ratification Process}
\label{de-ratification-process}
If a group is not performing or achieving certain standards, they may be
de-ratified.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item
  The de-ratification process will occur at the Winter General Meeting.
 \item
  The DoC shall be responsible for compiling a list of groups that shall undergo the de-ratification process. A motion for de-ratification may be proposed at the discretion of the DoC, but reasons could include that the group:

  \begin{enumerate}
   \item
    Does not present at either General Meeting in that year, nor explains their absence to council
   \item
    Does not attend ClubsFest, or any outreach events during the academic year
   \item
    Does not host events or maintain any social media presence during the academic year
  \end{enumerate}
 \item
  The DoC will be responsible for communicating with groups that may be facing de-ratification.
 \item
  The DoC will present to Council all groups that shall under-go the de-ratification process, and, upon approval from Council, these groups shall be presented and voted for de-ratification at the Winter General Meeting.
 \item
  Clubs, Teams, and Affiliates may all be subject to the de-ratification process
 \item
  Recognized groups will be deratified if they are disbanded by the organization they are ratified by.
\end{enumerate}
